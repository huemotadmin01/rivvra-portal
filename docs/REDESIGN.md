# Redesign — working agreements

The migration of the portal onto the design system delivered in
`Rivvra Design System.zip`. Companion docs: `STAGING.md` (environment,
branch strategy), `REDESIGN-QA.md` (test matrix).

## Where things live

| Layer | Path | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Design system | `src/components/ds/` | Presentational primitives. No routing, no data fetching, no domain vocabulary. Each component has a `.d.ts` contract beside it. |
| App-layer kits | `src/components/platform/v2/listkit.jsx` | URL binding only — reads/writes the query string and hands values to controlled `ds/` components. |
| Domain compositions | `src/components/outreach/v2/leadskit.jsx`, `src/components/ats/config/v2/sectionsV2.jsx` | Compositions that encode one app's vocabulary (a "lead", an "ATS picklist"). Built from `ds/`, never duplicating it. |
| Pages | `src/pages/**/*V2.jsx` | Data fetching, page composition. Import components **only** from `@/components/ds` (plus the kits above). |

**The rule that keeps this honest:** if a page needs a primitive that does
not exist in `ds/`, build it in `ds/` with a `.d.ts` — never in the page.
Phase 1 existed to repair exactly that drift; eleven primitives had
accumulated in the kit files, and `InlineSelect` was being imported by two
shared modules *from a page file*.

### Controlled vs. bound

`ds/` filter controls are **controlled**: they take `value` + `onChange` and
know nothing about the URL. The URL-bound variants (`SelectChipV2`,
`ArchivedToggleV2`, …) live in `listkit.jsx` as thin adapters. This is
deliberate — a design-system component that calls `useSearchParams` is
coupled to React Router and cannot be used in a modal, a drawer, or a
non-routed surface.

## Styling: inline styles in `ds/` are permanent (Option A)

Three mechanisms are in play — Tailwind (legacy pages and page-level
layout), inline styles (`ds/` components), and `shell.css` (the v2 app
shell). That is settled as follows:

- **`ds/` components keep inline styles.** They read semantic tokens
  (`var(--surface-1)`, `var(--fg-2)`, `var(--r-2)`), so theming, the
  light/dark swap and density all work exactly as they do for Tailwind
  classes. Values in the handoff `.jsx` are the spec; keeping them inline
  keeps each component byte-comparable against the handoff, which is what
  makes "did we drift from the design?" answerable by diff.
- **Page-level layout uses Tailwind or inline styles as convenient.** Page
  files are not spec artifacts.
- **`shell.css` stays** as the one stylesheet, scoped under `.ds-shell`,
  because the shell is a fixed chrome with pseudo-elements and media
  queries that inline styles cannot express.

**Why not Option B (convert `ds/` to Tailwind):** the conversion is a
mechanical rewrite of ~30 components with no user-visible outcome, it
breaks diff-against-handoff permanently, and the bundle argument does not
hold here — these styles are static objects hoisted by the bundler, and the
Tailwind class strings would be additive to a stylesheet that already ships.
Revisit only if a measured bundle or lint problem appears.

**Known cost, accepted:** three `ds/` components (`SelectChip`,
`GroupByChip`, `MoreFilters`) render popovers using the `.pop`, `.pop-item`
and `.pop-label` classes from `shell.css`. Every v2 page renders inside
`.ds-shell`, so this works today. If a `ds/` consumer ever lives outside the
shell, those three classes must travel with it. Noted in each file.

## Standing rules

1. Every migrated page ships behind `PageSwitch`. The legacy component stays
   until the v2 one has been live and quiet for two weeks.
2. New pages import components only from `@/components/ds`.
3. Where a component's `.jsx` and any document disagree, the `.jsx` wins.
4. Do not fork token values. Components read `src/styles/ds-tokens.css`.
5. Server-refused operations must not be described as soft in confirm copy
   (CRM stages, CRM lost reasons and ATS stages 400-block deletion while in
   use).
6. Never trigger outside staging: payroll publish, invoice post/send, sign
   request send, sequence activation, team invite, F&F settlement, bulk
   actions, announcement dismissal.

## Deprecations in flight

| Shim | Replacement | Remove after |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/v2/configkit.jsx` (re-exports `ConfigListV2`, `ConfigDot`) | `ds` → `ConfigList`, `ConfigDot` | phase 2 |
| `PageHeaderV2` re-export in `listkit.jsx` | `ds` → `PageHeader` | phase 2 |
| `ds/Surface/ConfigList.jsx` importing `shared/ConfirmDialog` | `ConfirmDialog` promoted into `ds/` | slice 6 |
